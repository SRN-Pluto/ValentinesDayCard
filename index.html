            <h1>To My Dearest Girlfriend/Wife ❤️ </h1>
            <h2>
              Every single day that goes by I miss you. I miss you lots and lots
              more than you will ever know. Although I think this day is overrated,
              I can't help but miss you when I see the cute stuff everyone else does.
              Things would have turned out way different if we could be together today,
              but how i see things it does not need to be valentines day for me to treat
              you special. I will always treat you like your my number one.
            </h2>
            <h2>
              Unfortunately we live quite far apart, but that distance is just a number.
              And this said distance is a temporary thing. As much as it can be painful
              when we need each others physical touch and love. Once our long distance is over
              I can assure you that everything we went through will be worth it, and days like
              this Valentine's Day will be spent with us holding each other hands and going to places
              you always wanted to go to.
            </h2>
            <h2>
              So what if we can't celebrate Valentine's Day together right now?
              It does not define our relationship. And it is not the end of time either!
              There will be many many many more Valentine's Days to be celebrated with you,
              and everything will be okay. Besides, we don't need a Valentine's Day to tell each
              other how much we mean to each other. Everyday spent with you is all i could ever ask for.
            </h2>
            <h2>
              I tried so hard to pass this day as another day on the calendar. But
              I could not, and the truth is i really miss you and I am waiting for
              the day we get to meet again, and i express all the love i have for you.
              I will spoil you with lots of sweeties and nuggies, and give you all the
              physical love and affection that you always wanted and needed. But until
              that day we have to be patient, which we can both do!
            </h2>

            <h2>
              Last but not least, Happy Valentine’s Day, Ya Qalbi. I
              love you so much, and you know that. I miss you and I
              can't wait for the day I get to see your pretty eyes again
              in person, and hold your hand everywhere we go!
